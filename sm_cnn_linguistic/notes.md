# SM Linguistic Perspective Notes

- All the sentences in dev/train/test are split into dependency parsed 
but we have only parsed up until 60 tokens. 
- Since we'll be testing different dependency relationships, it's better 
if we dump the dependency parsings once and for all in a file, which can 
then be processed to choose appropriate dependencies
